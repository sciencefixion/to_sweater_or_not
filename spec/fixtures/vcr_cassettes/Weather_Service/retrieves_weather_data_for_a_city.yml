        DAY FOR PARTICULATES FROM 400 PM FRIDAY UNTIL 400 PM\nSATURDAY...\nThe Colorado
        Department of Public Health and Environment has\nissued the following...\nWHAT...Action
        Day for Particulates.\nWHERE...Douglas, Jefferson, Denver, western Arapahoe,
        western\nAdams, Broomfield, Boulder, Larimer, and Weld Counties\nWHEN...400
        PM Friday October 02 to 400 PM Saturday October 03\nIMPACTS...Action Day for
        Particulates is now in effect for the\nseven-county Denver-Boulder metropolitan
        area. Requests to limit\ndriving of non- ZEV vehicles (i.e., gas or diesel)
        are now in\neffect until at least 4 PM Saturday, October 3, 2020.  Areas of\nmoderate
        to heavy smoke have moved into the Front Range once\nagain, and are expected
        to continue through at least Saturday\nmorning due to increased activity on
        the Cameron Peak and Mullen\nwildfires. Smoke impacts are expected to be greatest
        in Larimer\nCounty including Fort Collins, with additional impacts in other\nareas
        of the northern Colorado Front Range including Greeley,\nLongmont, Boulder,
        and the Denver Metro area.For areas included in\nthis advisory that are not
        expected to exceed the Unhealthy for\nSensitive Groups (USG) air quality designation,
        we request that\nactivities, such as driving non-ZEV vehicles (i.e., gas or\ndiesel),
        be reduced to lessen the impacts on neighboring air\nquality. Additional air
        pollution in this region may directly\nworsen air quality or contribute to
        precursors which may also\nadversely affect air quality.  For Colorado air
        quality\nconditions, forecasts and advisories, visit:\nhttps://www.colorado.gov/airquality/colorado_summary.aspx\nHEALTH
        INFORMATION...If smoke is thick or becomes thick in your\nneighborhood you
        may want to remain indoors. This is especially\ntrue for those with heart
        disease, respiratory illnesses, the very\nyoung, and the elderly. Consider
        limiting outdoor activity when\nmoderate to heavy smoke is present. Consider
        relocating\ntemporarily if smoke is present indoors and is making you ill.
        If\nvisibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in your neighborhood,\nsmoke
        has reached levels that are unhealthy."}]}'
