        DAY FOR PARTICULATES FROM 400 PM SUNDAY UNTIL 400 PM\nMONDAY...\nThe Colorado
        Department of Public Health and Environment has\nissued the following...\nWHAT...Action
        Day for Particulates.\nWHERE...Douglas, Jefferson, Denver, western Arapahoe,
        western\nAdams, Broomfield, Boulder, Larimer, and Weld Counties\nWHEN...400
        PM Sunday September 20 to 400 PM Monday September 21\nIMPACTS...Action Day
        for Particulates is now in effect for the\nseven-county Denver-Boulder metropolitan
        area. Requests to limit\ndriving of non- ZEV vehicles (i.e., gas or diesel)
        are now in\neffect until at least 4 PM Monday, September 21, 2020.  Smoke
        from\nthe Cameron Peak and Mullen wildfires will result in elevated\nlevels
        of fine particulates across the Front Range on Monday. Fine\nparticulate concentrations
        in the Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups\ncategory will mainly be confined to
        parts of Weld and southeastern\nLarimer Counties, including Ft. Collins and
        Greeley. For areas\nincluded in this advisory that are not expected to exceed
        the\nUnhealthy for Sensitive Groups (USG) air quality designation, we\nrequest
        that activities, such as driving non- ZEV vehicles (i.e.,\ngas or diesel),
        be reduced to lessen the impacts on neighboring\nair quality. Additional air
        pollution in this region may directly\nworsen air quality or contribute to
        precursors which may also\nadversely affect air quality.  For Colorado air
        quality\nconditions, forecasts and advisories, visit:\nhttps://www.colorado.gov/airquality/colorado_summary.aspx\nHEALTH
        INFORMATION...If smoke is thick or becomes thick in your\nneighborhood you
        may want to remain indoors. This is especially\ntrue for those with heart
        disease, respiratory illnesses, the very\nyoung, and the elderly. Consider
        limiting outdoor activity when\nmoderate to heavy smoke is present. Consider
        relocating\ntemporarily if smoke is present indoors and is making you ill.
        If\nvisibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in your neighborhood,\nsmoke
        has reached levels that are unhealthy."}]}'
